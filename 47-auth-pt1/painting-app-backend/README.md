- Goal
    - Login form will send username & password to our backend
    - Backend will verify that the user is who they say they are
    - Backend will create and encode a token including user id
    - Backend will send the token back to the front end

- Pt 2
    - On subsequent requests, the front-end will send the token containing user id to the backend, where it will be decoded and handled appropriately.
